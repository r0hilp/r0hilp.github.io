## Expositions/Course Notes:
Here are some scattered writings/notes, posted in case anyone can get some use out of them. Of course, any errors are mine and mine alone. 

1. [The Seiberg-Witten Invariant of a Homology S^1 x S^3](https://r0hilp.github.io/assets/docs/harvard_thesis.pdf). My senior undergraduate thesis on Seiberg-Witten theory. 

1. [The Grothendieck Spectral Sequence](https://r0hilp.github.io/assets/docs/grothendieck_ss.pdf). These were notes for a talk given at the Harvard Undergraduate Topology Seminar in Fall 2017. It constructs the Grothendieck spectral sequence and gives an application in constructing dualizing sheaves for projective varieties. 

2. [An Introduction to Derived Functors](https://r0hilp.github.io/assets/docs/tutorial_derived_functors.pdf). This was my final paper for Harvard's Spring 2016 tutorial on category theory. 

3. [The Book of Fibrations: An Introduction to the Serre Spectral Sequence](https://r0hilp.github.io/assets/docs/serre_spectral_sequence.pdf). This was my final paper for Harvard's Math 231a in Fall 2015. It constructs the Serre spectral sequence and does a bunch of the diagram chases, as well as some computations. 

4. [Spheres on Spheres: Adams Operations and the Hopf Invariant](https://r0hilp.github.io/assets/docs/adams_operations.pdf). This was my final paper for Harvard's Math 231br in Spring 2016. It details the Adams-Atiyah proof using Adams operations on K-Theory of the Hopf invariant one problem.
