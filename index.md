Hi, I'm Rohil, a senior undergraduate studying mathematics at Harvard University. I'm interested in low-dimensional topology, gauge theory, and geometric analysis. 

You can reach me at prasad01 \[magical email symbol goes here\] college.harvard.edu. I also have a [blog](https://rohilprasad.wordpress.com), but the updates are rather unreliable at the moment.
