Hi, I'm Rohil, a first-year PhD student studying mathematics at Princeton University. I'm interested in low-dimensional topology, gauge theory, and symplectic geometry. 

You can reach me at rrprasad \[magical email symbol goes here\] princeton.edu. I also have a [blog](https://rohilprasad.wordpress.com), but the updates are rather unreliable at the moment.
